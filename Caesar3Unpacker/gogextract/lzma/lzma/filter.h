 * \brief       Filter options

 * This structure is used to pass Filter ID and a pointer filter's

 * structure, while most functions expect a filter chain.
 *
 * A filter chain is indicated with an array of lzma_filter structures.
 * The array is terminated with .id = LZMA_VLI_UNKNOWN. Thus, the filter
 * array must have LZMA_FILTERS_MAX + 1 elements (that is, five) to
 * be able to hold any arbitrary filter chain. This is important when
 * using lzma_block_header_decode() from block.h, because too small
 * array would make liblzma write past the end of the filters array.

 * \brief       Update the filter chain in the encoder

 * different purposes:
 *
 *  - After LZMA_FULL_FLUSH when using Stream encoder: Set a new filter
 *    chain, which will be used starting from the next Block.
 *
 *  - After LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH using Raw, Block, or Stream encoder: Change
 *    the filter-specific options in the middle of encoding. The actual
 *    filters in the chain (Filter IDs) cannot be changed. In the future,
 *    it might become possible to change the filter options without
 *    using LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH.
 *
 * While rarely useful, this function may be called also when no data has
 * been compressed yet. In that case, this function will behave as if
 * LZMA_FULL_FLUSH (Stream encoder) or LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH (Raw or Block
 * encoder) had been used right before calling this function.
